# Message Loading Flow Analysis

## Component Structure

### WorkspacePage (page.tsx)
- Top-level component that manages workspace state
- Handles channel selection and message fetching at workspace level
- Maintains its own message state and polling mechanism

Key State:
- `selectedChannelId`: Currently selected channel
- `messages`: Array of messages for the current channel
- `isLoadingMessages`: Loading state for messages
- `searchQuery`: Current search query
- `selectedMessageId`: Message to scroll to

Message Flow:
1. Fetches messages on channel change
2. Sets up a 1-second polling interval for new messages
3. Passes messages down to MessageArea as `initialMessages`

### MessageArea (MessageArea.tsx)
- Handles message display, sending, and real-time updates
- Manages its own message state independent of parent
- Implements pagination and real-time updates

Key State:
- `messages`: Local message state, initialized from props but managed independently
- `lastFetchTimestamp`: Tracks newest message for real-time updates
- `initialFetchRef`: Tracks if initial message load is complete
- `nextCursor`: Used for pagination when scrolling up
- `hasMore`: Whether more historical messages exist
- `isFetchingMore`: Loading state for pagination

## Message Loading Process

### Initial Load
1. WorkspacePage fetches initial messages when channel changes
2. MessageArea receives these as `initialMessages`
3. MessageArea also starts its own fetch:
   - No timestamp parameters on first load
   - Sets `initialFetchRef` to true after successful load
   - Scrolls to bottom after loading

### Real-time Updates
1. WorkspacePage polls every 1 second
2. MessageArea polls every 5 seconds with:
   - Uses `lastFetchTimestamp` to get only new messages
   - Merges new messages with existing ones
   - Auto-scrolls if user is near bottom

### Historical Loading (Pagination)
1. Triggered when user scrolls near top
2. Uses `nextCursor` to fetch older messages
3. Merges with existing messages maintaining order

## Current Issues

1. **Duplicate Message Fetching**
   - Both parent and child components fetch messages
   - Could lead to race conditions and duplicate messages

2. **State Management Conflict**
   - Parent component's messages might conflict with child's state
   - Child maintains independent message state but receives prop updates

3. **Polling Overlap**
   - Two different polling intervals (1s and 5s)
   - Could cause message duplication or ordering issues

4. **Message Persistence**
   - Messages reset on channel change/reload because:
     - Parent's message state resets
     - Child's state resets
     - No coordination between the two states
